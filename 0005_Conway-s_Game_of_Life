#Conway's Game of Life
#Conway's Game of Life is an Example of Cellular automata
# Rules of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life
#1- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
#2- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
#3- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
#4- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
